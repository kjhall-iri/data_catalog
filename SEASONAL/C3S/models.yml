    description: Seasonal Prediction System, Version 3.5 (SPSv3.5). The System is based on a coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Global Climate Model, complemented by a number of additional modules. The System is operated monthly in Ensemble seasonal mode (6-month predictions) and is completed by a database of monthly ensemble hindcasts covering the period 1993-2016 which can be used to evaluate the performance of the System and to apply bias removal techniques from operational forecasts

  CPS2:
    description: JMA/MRI-CPS2 has various upgrades from its predecessor, JMA/MRI-CPS1, including improved resolution and physics in its atmospheric and oceanic components, introduction of an interactive sea-ice model and realistic initialization of its land component. Verification of extensive re-forecasts covering a 30-year period (1981–2010) demonstrates that JMA/MRI-CPS2 possesses improved seasonal predictive skills for both atmospheric and oceanic interannual variability as well as key coupled variability such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For ENSO prediction, the new system better represents the forecast uncertainty and transition/duration of ENSO phases.
