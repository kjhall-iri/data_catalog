    description: CanSIPSv2 consists of two global coupled models, CanCM4i and GEM-NEMO. CanCM4i applies an improved initialization to the same version of the CanCM4 model used previously in CanSIPSv1 (see section 3). This model is described in detail in Merryfield et al. (2013), and therefore only its most basic aspects are outlined here. On the other hand, GEM-NEMO is a new model introduced to CanSIPSv2 and will be described in detail.

    description: GFDL’s CM2.1 climate model, incorporating 1o ocean and 2o atmospheric components, was developed to produce output and science for the IPCC 4th assessment report. When evaluated over a broad suite of metrics this model was found to produce a high quality simulation of the present-day climate and its variability. In addition to other applications, GFDL uses the CM2.1 model for experimental seasonal predictions as part of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME).

    description: The GFDL Forecast-oriented Low Ocean Resolution version of CM2.5 (FLOR) model is a descendent of the CM2.5 model and CM2.1 model. The FLOR model incorporates the higher horizontal resolution in the atmosphere and land, higher vertical resolution in the atmosphere, and significantly improved land model (LM3) from CM2.5. The FLOR model also uses the relatively low-resolution ocean and sea ice components of CM2.1. These choices create a coupled model that is relatively computationally efficient, but can be used to address problems of regional climate and extremes.

    description: The NASA GMAO seasonal forecasts are produced with the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model and Data Assimilation System Version S2S_2.1. The new system replaces version S2S-1_0 described in Borovikov et al (2017), and includes upgrades to many components of the system. The atmospheric model includes an upgrade from a pre-MERRA-2 version running on the latitude-longitude grid at ~1 degree resolution to a current version running on the cubed sphere grid at approximately 1/2 degree resolution. The important developments are related to the dynamical core (Putman et al., 2011), the moist physics (“two-moment microphysics” of Barahona et al., 2014) and the cryosphere (Cullather et al., 2014). As in the previous GMAO S2S system, the land model is that of Koster et al (2000).

    description: The second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979–2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982–2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales.
