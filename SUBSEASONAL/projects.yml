    description: The Subseasonal Experiment (SubX) is a NOAA/Climate Testbed project focused on subseasonal predictability and predictions. Seven global models are producing seventeen years of ensemble retrospecive forecasts initialized weekly to investigate subseasonal prediction and predictability. Additionally, one-year of real-time predictions will be produced and provided to the NOAA/NWS Climate Prediction Center as additional guidance for their week-3/4 outlooks. Each modeling group follows the SubX Protocol for their re-forecasts and real-time forecasts. The project will test the skill of individual prediction systems as well as multi-model combinations.
